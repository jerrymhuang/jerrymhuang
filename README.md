I'm a doctoral candidate in Architectural Sciences (specialization in Acoustics) and a MS researcher in Cognitive Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute;

Graduated in Architectural Sciences (MS) and Architecture (BArch) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute;

Making awesome stuff for immersive rooms of all kinds [@craive-lab](https://craive-lab.gitbook.io) [(GitHub)](https://github.com/craive-lab);

My interest is highly interdisciplinary, spanning from Bayesian Machine Learning to Computational Cognitive Modeling, Virtual Reality, Architecture, and Acoustics, with extensive research and teaching experience in both technical **and** creative domains.
