### Hi, I am Jerry. 👋

🔭 Currently transitioning to be a Postdoctoral Researcher in Cognitive Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).

🎓 Graduating in May 2025 as PhD in Architectural Sciences, also at RPI.

✨ Interested in Simulation-Based Inference, Computational Cognitive Modeling, and Bayesian Machine Learning. 

🌱 In my spare time, I am an artist interested in public art and virtual reality. I lead the [Iris Collective](https://github.com/iris-collective), a creative group for immersive art and technologies.

📫 If you are interested in collaboration or hiring me as a tenure-tracked faculty member, please contact me by [mail](aca.jerryh@gmail.com).
