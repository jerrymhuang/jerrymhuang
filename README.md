### Hi, I am Jerry. ðŸ‘‹

I am a doctoral candidate in Architectural Sciences and a researcher in Cognitive Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

My interest spans from Bayesian Machine Learning to Computational Cognitive Modeling, Virtual Reality, Architecture, and Acoustics. 

As a researcher, I make cool things for immersive rooms of all kinds [@craive-lab](https://craive-lab.gitbook.io) [(GitHub)](https://github.com/craive-lab).

If you are interested in collaboration, please contact me by [mail](aca.jerryh@gmail.com).
